# Document Everything

_Inspired by Gary V_

## The Utility
I started this repo as part of an initiative to launch a vlog or other digital media content. I'll be looking into building a utility that assists me with:

* recording audio/video and uploading straight to soundcloud/youtube/whatever
* creating a platform that allows easy or straightforward editing of these contents
* integration between my own site, dev.to, and medium so that I don't have to edit content in several places

For my dev experience, I want to emphasize:

* thorough planning, less code by coincidence (though there will be time for that!)
* test driven development. Make it good


## Written Word
Though the intent of this project will be to create a platform that should assist in "documenting everything", I also intend to write about it in my [blog](https://ianwilson.io).
